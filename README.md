giphy api assignment
This assignment was pretty challenging as my JQuery isn't up to par. I was impressed I finally got the new button appended from the input box but couldn't wrap my brain around getting the API to respond to the new button and have gifs show up. This was a challenge in the making as i'm going to figure out how to get that part done. 

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
^^got this challenge done without a problem as I just used the template from class and was able to add at the end of the API Key.

Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
^^this is what I need to work on. my jQuery pushing and appending.
