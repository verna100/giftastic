giphy api assignment
This assignment was pretty challenging as my JQuery isn't up to par. I was impressed I finally got the new button appended from the input box but couldn't wrap my brain around getting the API to respond to the new button and have gifs show up. This was a challenge in the making as i'm going to figure out how to get that part done.
